Release 0.3.0 (2016-??-??)
--------------------------

### Enhancements

* URL path parameter format can accept parameter type (`int`, `str`, `date`).  
  ex: `/api/books/{id:int}`, `/blog/{entry_date:date}`

* `K8::Util::TemporaryFile` class added. It allows you to create temporary
  file which will be removed automatically *after* sending response body.  
  See document of `K8::Util::TemporaryFile` for details.

* `K8::Util::ShellCommand` class added. It allows you to send command output
  as response body. For example, execute SQL, convert into CSV, and send it
  as response.  
  See document of `K8::Util::ShellCommand` for details.

* `@action_args` is available in `K8::Action` class.  
  `@action_args` represents URL path parameter arguments.  
  For example, `@action_args == [123]` when urlpath pattern is `/books/{id}`
  and request path is `/books/123`.

* `@req.params_form()`, `@req.params_multipart()` and `@req.params_json()`
  now take max content length.  
  ex:

      strs = @req.params_form(10*1024*104)  # max: 10MB
      strs = @req.params_form               # same as above

      strs, files = @req.params_multipart(100*1024*1024)  # max: 100MB
      strs, files = @req.params_multipart                 # same as above

      hash = @req.params_json(10*1024*104)  # max: 10MB
      hash = @req.params_json               # same as above

* Add `K8::ActionMapping#urlpath_rexp`.
  You can confirm regexp of action mapping by that attribute.  
  ex:

      ## what regexp is used for request routing?
      mappings = [
        ['/api', [
          ['/books',    BooksAction],
          ['/authors',  AuthorsAction],
        ]
      ]
      p K8::ActionMapping.new(mapping).urlpath_rexp

* Regard '.*' at end of urlpath pattern as extension pattern.  
  ex:

      class BooksAPI < K8::Action

        ## ex: '.*' is same as '{_:<(?:\.\w+)?>}'
        mapping '.*'     , :GET=>:do_index

	## ex: '/{id}.*' is same as '/{id}{_:<(?:\.\w+)?>}'
        mapping '/{id}.*', :GET=>:do_show

	def do_index
	  p @req.path_ext    #=> ex: '.json', '.html', etc
        end
	def do_show(id)
	  p @req.path_ext    #=> ex: '.json', '.html', etc
        end
      end

* Define `@req.path_ext` which returns such as `.json` or `.html`.

* `@resp.set_cookie()` now accepts Time object as `expires` keyword arg.

* New HTTP response status codes are added.

### Incomppatible changes

* URL path parameter format is changed.  
  (old) `/books/{id:\d+}`  
  (new) `/books/{id:int}` or `/books/{id:int<\d+>}`  
  See document for details.

* Rename `@req.method` to `@req.meth`.  
  `@req.method` is also available, but not recommended. Use `@req.meth`.

* Rename `K8::BaseAction[]#method` to `K8::BaseAction[]#meth`.  
  ex:

      p BooksAction[:do_show].meth     #=> :GET
      p BooksAction[:do_update].meth   #=> :PUT
      p BooksAction[:do_delete].meth   #=> :DELETE

* Rename `K8::BaseAction[]#urlpath()` to `BooksAction[]#path()`.  
  ex:

      p BooksAction[:do_show].path(123)     #=> "/api/books/123"
      p BooksAction[:do_update].path(123)   #=> "/api/books/123"
      p BooksAction[:do_delete].path(123)   #=> "/api/books/123"

* Rename `@current_action` to `@action_name` in `K8::Action` class.
  It represents current action name, such as `:do_index` or `:do_show`.

* `@req.params` now raises `K8::PayloadParseError` when request format is multipart.
  Use `@req.params_multipart` instead for multipart request.
